## A short description answering the questions (for the advanced target)
### Q(b)

We find there is Momentum effect exists in Chinese stock markets.
As we can see in the return spread between the highest previous return group and the lowest group, when K=1, the return rate difference is 26.85%, which is very considerable. As the lagged period number K increases, we witness a stricly decreasing return rate difference. When K =3, it is 15.23%; when K = 6, it is 10.65%; when K = 12, it is 7.56%; when K = 24, it is 5.37%. This indicates two points economically. First, we do not deny the potential existence of Reversal effect, but in less than two years, it can be hard to observe it, if does exist. Second, the Momentum effect is declining with longer lagged periods. This suits the economic intuition since we believe the potential profit from arbitrage will decrease along the time, and disappear eventually in the long term.


### Q(c)

- PC1
The first principal component captures the common trend in the dataset.
Economically, PC1 might calibrate the overall market fluctuation or a "market factor" that affects all portfolios.
If all portfolio returns fluctuate together to some extent, PC1 would capture this shared variance. And the effect of PC1 is much more significant than other component.
- PC2
The second principal component captures the next most significant pattern in the data after eliminating the effect of the first factor, while showing a much less volume of effect.(PC1 is more than 10times stronger than PC2)
In economic terms, PC2 might represent a sector-specific or style-specific trend, such as a growth vs. value factor, or a size factor (large-cap vs. small-cap).
PC2 might be highlighting variations in portfolio returns that are not explained by broad market movements.
